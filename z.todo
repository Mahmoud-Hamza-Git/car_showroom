notes:
  ☐ to use inset use box-shadow insread of border (box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 3px #000;)  the 4th value represents the radious of the border
  
Soleve_Problems:
  ☐ i made position absolute for an overlay on images but forgot about the positioning properties (top, left), so the overlay appeared shifted to the next line 😀 overlay on other image😂
  ☐ we can separate even small titles in components if they are repeated even if the style changes alittle bit, we can handle it using props in styled components
  ☐ apply the transform to all child cards by 100% they will be shifted (to make slider)
done:
  ☐ using react-intersection-observer to detect intersection and apply function
